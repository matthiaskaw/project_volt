- implement proper exception handling for devices
- deserialize measurement settings and set values of devices



27.06.2024 Branch: Refactor-Initialize:

- Initialization is a central function. Now every possible device is initialized at the beginning
- DeviceController and MeasurementController need to be independent
- Measurement and Sensor polling are different tasks. Maybe call MeasurementController "TaskController"
- data rate from measurements and from sensor are is not adjusted by MeasurementController; Either the device send 
- Implement Cancel function
- Automate diameter calculation based on DMA settings for SMPS and TandemDMA/Temperature measurements
